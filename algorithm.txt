Types: No change, wiggle/grow/shrink, merge/split, loop creation/annihilation, string creation/annihilation

DOUBLE CHECK THIS

1. Get list of strings from both frames
2. Detect strings which are exactly the same, classify as no change and remove from list
3. Detect strings which connect exactly the same set of composite squares between frames, mark these 
    a. If multiple strings in the same frame touch the same set of composite squares, use the number of shared points from one frame to the next to determine correspondance
4. Classify  the corresponding strings from the previous step as wiggle/grow/shrink and remove from list
5. When the set of composite squares touched by two touching strings (must be at least 3 composite squares) contains the set of composite squares touched be the next/previous string, it is a merge/split. Classify and remove.
6. The remaining non-loop strings are considered to be string creation/deletion
7. The remaining strings will all be loops. Loops that share at least one composite square between frames will be marked as corresponding. 
    a. If there is ambiguity (ie multiple loops in the same composite square on the same frame), use shared points as a tiebreak
8. unpaired loops from the previous step are classified as loop creation/annihilation
